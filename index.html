          <h2>- How -</h2>
          <p>
            How we developed Hallow-Cat is very simple. First we interview our target audience to see what issues they're having and then from there, we develop our product.
            Hallow-Cat was then created from a series of concept-art, using Circuit Playgrounds, various other bibs and bobs, and of course; the code powering the machine.

        <div class="text_bubble">
          <h2>- Why -</h2>
          <p>
            The reason why we developed Hallow-Cat is not only because we had a school project surrounding the subject-matter, but also the drive to create something that actually helps someone.
            Through careful consideration and planning, this is our end product!
